# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
It takes a text file of a book, breaks down how many words are in the text, total character count by character, as well as how many times a vowel shows up.
Produces a simple report with all of the information in a easy to read output.

Text used in testing is from https://www.gutenberg.org/ via their free audio books library.
